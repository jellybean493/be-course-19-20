# Week 8

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
> having to look at its code.
> This is very important.
> This makes it possible for you to separate your moduleâ€™s documented interface
> from its internal implementation (guts).
> This is good because it means that you are free to change the moduleâ€™s
> internals as long as the interface remains the same.
>
> Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.

_This week A2 will take place, you can continue working on your prototype. There are no assignments due next week (or any future week_.

## Review

In the lab we'll do a **peer review** by having a look at the assessment checklist and the rubric. After that teachers have time to answer questions.

**A2 review:**  
This is a peer review document you can fill-in on the project of your fellow student. It's a good last check to see if everything is in order.

â†’ [Student Review][review-student]

**A2 rubric:**  
This is the rubric your teacher will grade you on. Ask yourself upon completion if everything is clear and that you understand each row and column, if not ask your teacher!

â†’ [Rubric][rubric]

**Questions:**  
Make sure you come to the lab prepared in advance:

* Know which questions you want to ask.
* If you have a bug, investigate and try to make a detailed explanation of your problem.
* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem.

## Assessment

Based on the repository, source code and live version you **present your final application with your team**. Then you'll show how you contributed to the project and explain if you reached your own goals you've set at the beginning of the project. A teacher will look through the code your contributed and ask questions. By answering questions you demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals. 

> This is a team assessment but you'll be graded individually! Each prototype contains an individually recognizable contribution of you based on the learning goals of this course. So, you need to show you worked on something for back-end. For example; you can't just work on the CSS of the project because that was your role.

### Preparation

Presenting your work is a skill all by itself, make sure you prepare yourself properly. The best way is to treat it as [public speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking) and there are [many books](https://be.noti.st/2018/recommended-books-for-public-speakers) on public speaking available.

## Hand-in
Make sure you hand-in your work in the assignment on Brightspace
* A link to your team repository and your contribution
* A link to the live project
* A `zip` file of your code (for archive purposes)
