## Oral Test - Team

You've worked iteratively (_formative_) on your product and finish with an oral test (_summative_) where you **present your final prototype** with your **team**. 

First you'll present the whole project as a team to all the teachers. Then you'll show how you contributed to the project and explain if you reached your own goals you've set at the beginning of the project. You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

> **This is a team assessment but you'll be graded individually!** Each prototype contains an individually recognizable contribution of you based on the learning goals of this course. So, you need to show you worked on something for back-end. For example; you can't just _work on the CSS of the project_ because that was your role. **Working with CSS is not a learning goal of this course.**

> A teacher can [refuse to take the assessment][refuse] when you show up late regardless of the reason. That means you go straight to the re-sits and will be graded with a `1.0`. Usually teachers give you a small window of time after the assessment(~5 minutes) to show up.

### Preperation
Presenting your work is a skill all by itself, make sure you prepare yourself properly. The best way is to treat it as [public speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking) and there are [many books](https://be.noti.st/2018/recommended-books-for-public-speakers) on public speaking available.

* **Bring your computer** and make sure it's _charged_ and connected to _Wifi_.
* Have the latest version of your code **ready on GitHub**
* Have the latest version of your code **ready in your editor**.
* Open up your docs inside of your GitHub repository.
* Have a **live version** up and running.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the test is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the test. We also want to download and archive your project when itâ€™s done.

        The way the student applies Git, npm, databases, and Node is more advanced than what they were taught in class; letâ€™s switch places

      <td align="center">The student can explain every part of their code, how everything works together, and why software is used instead of alternatives; the project is structured logically</td>
      <td align="center">The project is complex but still understandable; the student carefully chose every part of their stack; software is used that was not covered in class; the student can make live changes</td>
      <td align="center">
        ðŸ¤“<br>
        The student understands JavaScript and Nodeâ€™s programming principles and a geeky / nerdy conversation can be held about these principles

    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Quality</th>
      <td align="center">The project is handed in documented, on time, working, and on GitHub; in other words: proper</td>
      <td align="center">Code style is consistent (semicolons or not? double or single quotes? spaces or tabs? how many spaces? nestingâ€¦); code, project, and process are partially documented</td>
      <td align="center">Code adheres to standards; docs cover what the project is and does and the students process and choices</td>
      <td align="center">Code quality is good and enforced; docs are useful and professional</td>
      <td align="center">
        ðŸ“š<br>
        Code and docs both read like great books

> **Note:**  
> _you'll need a > 5.5 for each row to pass:_  you can't compensate between rows  
> _each of this rubricâ€™s rows is cumulative:_ for example, to get a 5-6 on concept, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4.
