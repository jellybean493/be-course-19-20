# Tips and Tricks

## 'This course is hard'

When you start with a technical course you'll probably will think it's hard, especially back-end. That's because all other courses on CMD Amsterdam are too easy ;) 

Regardless, students grade this course with a `8`. They find it hard `6/7` but also fun `5.8/7`. This is probably trough a couple of reasons:

* The materials are not **hard** but **new**. Getting a grasp on topics for this course takes time but that doesn't mean they are difficult.
* You experience Imposter Syndrome (detailed below)
* The Gap (detailed below) between what you have in mind and what you can create is too big

### Code competence

> Your confidence is highly correlated with your happiness and because the point where your confidence and capabilities match is the best proxy

### The Gap

> For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.

### Imposter syndrome

> Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which one doubts one's accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud"

## 'Where do I start?'

### Start small
First make it work then make it beautiful. Start with an un-styled input field and make sure it works. Then expand to a full form.

### Pick things to integrate
Don't switch between project tech, front-end and back-end but instead work on 'one layer'.

## Get the most out of this course
Easy is boring. Don't just do what is asked from you. When you play you'll want more and more, take on that challenge and make it harder for yourself. That's where the real learning happens.
