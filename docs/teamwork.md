# Teamwork

## Attendance
This course is highly participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions and give feedback to peers. Attendance to class is not compulsory. 80% of success is showing up though, so show up.

## Team-mate

This course includes team work. Everybody hates that one team mate that doesn’t do anything. **Don’t be that team mate**. Participation in team work is compulsory and part of your grade. In the end you'll be **graded individually** so make the most of it.
